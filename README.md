# My Dotfiles

Here I will share my dot files I will start using on my systems 
I will keep building on them until I'm happy
feel free to steal anything that you fancy from these files to use in your own dot files!

Have a nice day :)

##### Please ignore the crappyness
I'm really sorry if you think my dotfiles are a peaces of junk. I know my excuses will not make up for the awefullness of my dot files but they are for me and my pcs they are not on your system so just ignore them.
Also I mostly use Debian/Ubuntu based distro's \*cough\* Elemetary OS \*cough\* if you find that these distos are crap then please also ignore these dotfiles.
